# Stages

This is the stages source code directory for POSIX Pipelines

## Manifest

    manifest            this file (see counterpart one level up)
    configure           configurator script
    makefile.in         skeleton makefile
    makefile            generated
    configure.h         generated
    configure.sh        generated

## Stage Sources that we Have Now

    buffer.c            hold all records in memory until input closes
    console.c           read from stdin if first, write to stdout otherwise
    literal.c           prepend a record to the stream with the literal string supplied
    strliteral.c        prepend a record to the stream with the literal string supplied
    fanin.c
    command.c

## Developmental, not delivered with the package

    brace.c                     development
    readtext1.c                 development
    readtext2.c                 development
    readtext.c                  development
