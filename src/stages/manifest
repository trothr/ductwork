# Stages

This is the stages source code directory for POSIX Pipelines

## Manifest

    manifest            this file (see counterpart one level up)
    configure           configurator script
    makefile.in         skeleton makefile
    makefile            generated
    configure.h         generated
    configure.sh        generated

## Stage Sources that we Have Now

    buffer.c            hold all records in memory until input closes
    console.c           read from stdin if first, write to stdout otherwise
    literal.c           prepend a record to the stream with the literal string supplied
    strliteral.c        prepend a record to the stream with the literal string supplied
    fanin.c             gather inputs one at a time
    command.c           issue commands to the local operating system
    cp.c                issue a CP or VMCP command (requires z/VM)
    cms.c               N/A apart from VM/CMS
    rxsample            a sample stage written in Rexx
    locate.c            find a needle in a haystack
    nlocate.c           exclude a needle from a haystack
    var.c               read a variable from the environment

## Developmental, not delivered with the package

    brace.c                     development

    readtext2.c                 development
    readtext.c                  development
